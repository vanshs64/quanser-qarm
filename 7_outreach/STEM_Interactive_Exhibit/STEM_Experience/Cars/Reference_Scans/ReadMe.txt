#  Quanser QCar Reference Scan #
#		  	       #
# ---------------------------- #

Before running STEM Experience for the very first time, the reference scans need to be downloaded to the QCars.
To this, run the following batch file:

	transfer_scans.bat

This batch file will remove any .mat files in the target directory (~/Documents) and copy the reference scans to 
that directory. You will be prompt to enter the password TWICE for EACH QCar used in the STEM Experience.
